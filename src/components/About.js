        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Universidade
          Positivo, with proficiency in C#, C++, JavaScript, Dart, and Haxe, as
          well as experience with the .NET, React, and Django frameworks and the
          Flutter SDK. During my early years at university, I had the
          opportunity to participate in an exchange program at Universidade da
          Beira Interior in Portugal, where I was able to deepen and enhance my
          studies. Upon my return, I completed a two-year internship at Renault,
          where I collaborated with the team to develop software and systems for
          all South America. Following this, I worked as a Junior Multimedia
          Programmer for one of the leading educational publishing companies in
          Brazil, Inca Tecnologia. There, I developed various educational 2D
          games as well as multiple mobile and web applications aimed at
          elementary and high school education

          In addition to my professional experiences, I also developed and maintain personal
          blog SpaceSheep â€“ in HTML, CSS, JS, and
          Bootstrap, using the React framework - to showcase my programming
          projects and other activities.
